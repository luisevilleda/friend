Problem

Parents are working a record number of hours, and our nation's children are suffering for it. FRIEND gives those neglected children a warm welcome home, a reminder to have a healthy snack, and to help them with their homework.

Solution

FRIEND is an integrated Alexa/desktop service that provides a central place for parents to track their children's responsibilities and safety. Alexa gently prompts the child to provide information about his/her day, records required homework, reminds them about their chores, and suggests eating a healthy snack! Parents can check to see if their child made it home, assign chores, and send notes to their child through Alexa on their computers or mobile device.

Customer Quote

"I work 100 hours a week and don't have time to spend with my little Johnny at home. With FRIEND, I'm able to make sure that he's doing his homework and chores while I work. I'm now able to spend more quality time actually connecting with my son in the few hours I see him every week. Thanks FRIEND!" - Maria Averg√ºenza
